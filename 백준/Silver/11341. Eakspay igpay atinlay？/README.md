### 문제 설명

<p>Your job is to translate English phrases into Pig Latin. There are only two rules you need to know. First, for words beginning with a consonant or consonant cluster, you must cut off the consonant or consonant cluster, attach it to the end of the word, and add the letters “a” and “y” at the end of the word. Second, for words beginning with a vowel, you must simply add the letters “y”, “a”, and “y” at the end of the word. We will consider “y” to be a vowel for this problem. You may assume the words will consist of only lower case letters.</p>
